  <h1>How the AI Agent Works</h1>
  <p>Gorilla is not just a text generator; it is an autonomous agent that plans, codes, and fixes itself. To build apps with AI features</p>

  <h2>The 3-Step Process</h2>
  
  <h3>Phase 1: Planning</h3>
  <p>When you send a request, the <strong>Planner Agent</strong> analyzes your file structure. It creates a step-by-step "Todo List" of what files need to be created or modified.</p>

  <h3>Phase 2: Coding</h3>
  <p>The <strong>Coder Agent</strong> picks up the plan. It writes the code for each file. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It knows about modern frameworks (React, Vue, Tailwind).</li>
    <li>It automatically manages imports and dependencies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Phase 3: Healing (Auto-Fix)</h3>
  <p>This is the magic part. After writing the code, Gorilla tries to start the server. If the server crashes (e.g., a missing comma or wrong import), Gorilla <strong>reads the error log</strong>, understands what went wrong, and automatically writes a patch to fix it.</p>

  <div class="note">
    You might see messages like "Analyzing Crash..." or "Auto-Fixing". This is normal! It means the agent is polishing the code for you.

  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>One thing at a time:</strong> Don't ask for a database, a login system, and a payment gateway in one message. Break it down.</li>
    <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Complex changes might take 30-60 seconds as the AI thinks and writes.</li>
  </ul>
